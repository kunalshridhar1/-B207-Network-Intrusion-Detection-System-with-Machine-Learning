# This script initializes the SQLite database for the phishing email detection application.
# It creates the 'predictions' table if it doesn't exist and checks for the 'features' column.  
# If the 'features' column is missing, it adds it to the existing table.
# The database is used to store email predictions and their features for later analysis.    
# This script is designed to set up the database for the phishing email detection application.
# Make sure to run this script before running the main prediction script to ensure the database is ready
